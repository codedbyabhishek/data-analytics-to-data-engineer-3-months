# Week 0: Foundation for Complete Beginners

If you have zero technical background, do this week before Week 1.

## Goal
By the end of Week 0, you should be able to:
- Use your computer file system confidently.
- Open terminal and run basic commands.
- Create a GitHub account and push one small repo.
- Run a simple Python file.

## Daily Plan

## Day 1: Computer + File Basics
- Understand folders, files, extensions, and paths.
- Create a folder named `practice-week0`.
- Create and rename text files.

Checkpoint:
- You can find any file by path and explain where it is stored.

## Day 2: Terminal Basics
- Open terminal.
- Practice commands: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`.
- Navigate between folders without file explorer.

Checkpoint:
- You can create a folder and file from terminal only.

## Day 3: Git + GitHub Basics
- Install Git.
- Create GitHub account.
- Learn `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`.

Checkpoint:
- You create one local repo and one commit.

## Day 4: Push to GitHub
- Create a GitHub repository.
- Connect local repo to remote.
- Push your commit.

Checkpoint:
- Your repo is visible on GitHub with a README.

## Day 5: Python Basics
- Install Python.
- Run `python3 --version`.
- Write and run a `hello.py`.
- Practice variables, input/output, and simple math.

Checkpoint:
- You can run a Python file from terminal.

## Day 6: Mini Practice Day
- Create a Python script that:
  - Reads 3 numbers from user input.
  - Prints total and average.
- Commit and push script to GitHub.

Checkpoint:
- End-to-end: code -> commit -> push.

## Day 7: Review + Repeat
- Re-do Day 2 to Day 6 tasks without notes.
- Write your weak points in a note file.
- Repeat any topic that still feels confusing.

Checkpoint:
- You can do basic terminal + git + python tasks independently.

## Week 0 Pass Criteria
- 5+ study sessions completed.
- At least 1 public GitHub repo created.
- At least 3 commits pushed.
- 1 Python script built and explained in your own words.

If you fail pass criteria, repeat Week 0 once before moving to Week 1.
