# Project 3: Streaming + Data Quality Monitoring

## Goal
Build a near-real-time data flow with quality checks and basic alerting.

## Stack
- Kafka or equivalent queue
- Python stream consumer
- Validation framework or custom checks
- Dashboard/alerts for monitoring

## Scope
- Simulate or ingest event stream
- Process and aggregate stream data
- Validate schema + nulls + freshness
- Publish alerts when checks fail

## Deliverables
- Producer/consumer scripts
- Validation checks
- Monitoring dashboard or logs summary
- Incident notes (example issue + fix)

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness under delayed/bad data
- Monitoring coverage
- Operational clarity
