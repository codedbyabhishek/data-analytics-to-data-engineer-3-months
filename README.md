# Data Analytics to Data Engineer in 3 Months

A practical, project-based roadmap for going from zero to professional-level foundations in **Data Analytics + Data Engineering** in 12 weeks of disciplined work.

## Who this is for
- Absolute beginners who can commit to hard work for 3 months.
- Career switchers who want portfolio-ready projects.
- Analysts who want to level up into data engineering.

## Commitment
- **Daily:** 3-4 focused hours
- **Weekly:** 20-30 hours
- **Duration:** 12 weeks

## Outcomes by Week 12
- Strong SQL + Python for analytics and data pipelines
- Ability to design ETL/ELT pipelines
- Experience with data warehouses and orchestration tools
- 3 portfolio projects with documentation and business context
- Interview-ready stories and GitHub project proofs

## Repo Structure
- `week-by-week/` -> detailed roadmap
- `projects/` -> end-to-end project briefs
- `resources/` -> free and practical learning links/topics
- `templates/` -> trackers and planning templates
- `tools/` -> environment setup and workflow

## 12-Week Plan (Quick View)
- **Weeks 1-2:** Foundations (Python, SQL, Git, data basics)
- **Weeks 3-4:** Analytics workflow (EDA, BI dashboards, metrics)
- **Weeks 5-6:** Data modeling and warehousing fundamentals
- **Weeks 7-8:** Batch pipelines + orchestration
- **Weeks 9-10:** Streaming fundamentals + cloud concepts
- **Weeks 11-12:** Portfolio polish + interview prep + capstone

## Projects You Will Build
1. Analytics Dashboard with KPI storytelling
2. Batch Data Pipeline (ingest -> transform -> warehouse)
3. Near-Real-Time Pipeline + monitoring + data quality checks

See project briefs in [`projects/`](projects/).

## Suggested Daily Routine
1. Learn concept (45-60 min)
2. Practice exercises (60-90 min)
3. Build project feature (60-90 min)
4. Write notes + commit to GitHub (15-30 min)

## Rules for Success
- Build every week, do not only watch tutorials.
- Push code daily with clear commit messages.
- Write what business problem each project solves.
- Track progress in `templates/study-tracker.csv`.

## How to Start
1. Follow setup: [`tools/setup.md`](tools/setup.md)
2. Open roadmap: [`week-by-week/12-week-roadmap.md`](week-by-week/12-week-roadmap.md)
3. Start Week 1 and log daily progress.

## Optional Extensions (After Week 12)
- dbt advanced modeling
- Spark at scale
- Airflow production patterns
- Cloud-specific certifications (AWS/GCP/Azure)
